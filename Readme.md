## Setup and Installation

Install the library via pip:
```bash
pip install price-parser
```

---

## Features

- Extract numeric price values from strings.
- Detect currency symbols and convert them into readable currency names.
- Built on **Pydantic** for easy integration with modern Python projects.
- Lightweight and production-ready.

---

## Usage

### ParserTypePrice
Extract the numeric price value from a string as a **float**.

\`\`\`python
from price_parser import ParserTypePrice

price = ParserTypePrice(price_string="$19.99")
print(price.value)  # Output: 19.99
\`\`\`

---

### ParserTypeCurrency
Extract both the numeric price value and the currency details (symbol and name).

\`\`\`python
from price_parser import ParserTypeCurrency

price_info = ParserTypeCurrency(price_string="$19.99")
print(price_info.value)      # Output: 19.99
print(price_info.currency)   # Output: "USD"
print(price_info.symbol)     # Output: "$"
\`\`\`

---

## Example Use Cases

### Single Price Extraction
Parse a single price from a string:
\`\`\`python
from price_parser import ParserTypePrice

price = ParserTypePrice(price_string="â‚¬49,99")
print(price.value)  # Output: 49.99
\`\`\`

### Full Price Details
Extract both the price value and currency details:
\`\`\`python
from price_parser import ParserTypeCurrency

price_info = ParserTypeCurrency(price_string="â‚¹1,500")
print(price_info.value)      # Output: 1500.0
print(price_info.currency)   # Output: "INR"
print(price_info.symbol)     # Output: "â‚¹"
\`\`\`

### E-Commerce Data Processing
Ideal for processing pricing data from product listings.

\`\`\`python
from price_parser import ParserTypeCurrency

products = ["$19.99", "â‚¬15.50", "â‚¹1200"]
for product in products:
    info = ParserTypeCurrency(price_string=product)
    print(f"Price: {info.value}, Currency: {info.currency}, Symbol: {info.symbol}")
